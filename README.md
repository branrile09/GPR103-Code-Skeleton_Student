 Credits, Licenses & Attribution:
majority of drawn assets where done by myself excluding the poggers memes

music drum loop was sourced from looperman.com by sonicFury (file called darth lazor)
https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/151491/darth-lazor-150bpm-dubstep-drum-loop

gametrack was composed using backing track loop from above, and I wrote, recorded and composed the guitar myself

notes:
i aimed for a mostly self made library for my assets, to reflect my own creativity and lack of artistic skills
the use of metal music over poorly drawn assets is an artistic self reflection of how i see myself. 


Technical requirements:
not a potato
